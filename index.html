          <h3>My DFab Journal</h3>
        <p>11/11/2019</p>
        <p>I was thinking of designing a hand-wired mechanical keyboard using lazer-cut wood, acrylic and a microcontroller. How the keyboard works is dependent on the switches that
           trigger certain functions such as registering a keypress of an alphabet, through a microcontroller. The switches are seated on an acrylic plate that secures them and prevents
           them from moving about when using the keyboard. Both of those components would be encased by wood which would be the main casing of the keyboard. The method of building the
           keyboard includes soldering diodes into the switches and programming a matrix that recognizes which key is pressed.

           The switches are externally-bought component which will make use of the 3d printer where a small clip would be used to modify the feel and sound of the switch. The switches
           that I will be using are the [________], which produces a tactile feel with a 'click' sound at the middle of each keypress. The 3d printed clips would prevent the switch from
           clicking, thus being more silent as well as impacting the feel of the keypress. To stabilize the keys that are slightly longer, I am using GMK stabilizers.</p>
