        <h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my Digital Fabrication and Prototyping Fundamentals blog! My name is Rifky Yudistira and I'm 18 years old
          from Singapore Polytechnic, currently studying in the Diploma in Architecture (DARCH). I will be posting about my progress
          and achievements that I have made in this module, including 3D printing projects and my experience with CAD.</p>
          
          
        <h2>A Possible Final Project</h2> 
        <p>For my final project, I was thinking of creating my own hand wired mechanical keyboard. Doing my research, I found out that
           keyboards typically use a matrix circuit and a diode for every switch to register keypresses, and the matrix circuits 
           would then connect to the arduino. Here is a diagram of how a typical keyboard works:</p>
          
          <p class="photo"> <img src="Keyboard Matrix1.png"height="250" width="500"/></p>
          
        <p>My plan is to 3d print a case for the keyboard, and lazer cut an acrylic piece to hold the switches in place. To register the
           keypresses, I am going to use MX-style switches that are used primarily for keyboards. Here is an image of the switch that
          I am going to use:</p>
