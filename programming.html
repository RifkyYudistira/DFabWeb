          <h2>Embedded Programming</h2>
        <p>In this topic, we learnt more about how to program Arduinos, specifically using TinkerCAD as our main application.
           We were required to experiment and play around with different electrical components (like LEDs) that can interact
           with code stored in an Arduino.</p>
          
          <h2>Background Knowledge - Electrical Components</h2>
        <p>During the lessons, we learnt about a few electrical components that we may possibly use for our Final Year Project, which
           included LEDs, switches, motors and LCD displays. Here is a few things that I have learnt about these components:
          
        <p>LEDs
           - LEDs have a long ping and a short pin which denotes the polarity of each side where the longer pin is the cathode and the shorter side is the anode.
           - Too much current flowing into an LED will make it blow, so we need to use a resister so that the current is regulated.
           - Find the forward current/voltage the LED can take so that we can order the right resistor for it (where it is denoted in the website shop)</p>
