          <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>My class was tasked to create a website to document all of our progress and journey through the module via a github
           page, which meant that we had to learn html coding. Fortunately, I learnt most of the HTML coding through the YouTube
           video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk">Learn HTML in 12 Minutes</a> as well as
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE">Learn CSS in 12 Minutes</a>.</p>
          
          <h3>Creating My Website</h3>
        <p>In the creation of my own website, I had faced some challenges that have been resolved by useful websites like
           <a href="w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> which teaches you some of the basics of HTML coding. The website would
           give you a template code that you can copy and paste onto your own project and apply the necessary changes to it,
           and even provides an example of how to use and modify the code.</p>
          
        <p>During my web development, I had once faced the issue of inserting images into my website. Using w3schools, I found the
          template code that I needed which solved my problem.</p>
